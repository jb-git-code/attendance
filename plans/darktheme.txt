🎨 Dark Theme Design Plan (Black + Green)

Overview

The application includes a carefully designed dark theme focused on usability, minimalism, and long-term comfort.
The theme uses a soft black background combined with green as the primary accent color, creating a modern, premium, and productivity-focused experience.

Green is used intentionally to represent progress, growth, and positive attendance behavior, while layered dark surfaces and muted text colors reduce eye strain and visual clutter.

📝 Design Rationale

The dark theme is designed to balance clarity and comfort by using layered black shades and a restrained green accent.

The color system ensures that attention is drawn only to important actions and progress indicators, while the rest of the interface remains calm and distraction-free.

This approach supports long usage sessions, improves focus, and aligns with modern minimal UI principles.
