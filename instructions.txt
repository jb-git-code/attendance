Below is a clean, structured, easy-to-understand README.md written specifically for AI-assisted Flutter app generation.
It clearly explains what to build, how it should behave, and which tech stack to use, so an AI (or developer) can directly start implementing the app.

You can copy-paste this directly as your README.md.

📊 Smart Attendance Tracker (Flutter + AI)

📌 Project Overview

Smart Attendance Tracker is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help individuals track, manage, and improve their class attendance.
The app stores attendance locally on the device, allows full user control and editing, and uses Firebase Authentication for user login/signup.

The app also includes goal-based reminders and notifications to ensure the user meets weekly and subject-wise attendance targets.

⸻

🎯 Key Objectives
	•	Store attendance records locally for privacy and offline access
	•	Allow users to customize subjects and attendance goals
	•	Provide smart notifications to motivate attendance
	•	Display visual progress using graphs and progress bars
	•	Support secure login/signup using Firebase

⸻

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend
	•	Flutter (Dart)
	•	Material UI Components

Backend / Services
	•	Firebase Authentication (Login / Signup / Logout)
	•	No cloud database for attendance (attendance is stored locally)

Local Storage
	•	Hive / SharedPreferences / SQLite (any efficient local DB)
	•	Attendance data must persist even after app restart

Notifications
	•	Flutter Local Notifications
	•	Scheduled notifications (daily + weekly)

Charts & Visualization
	•	FL Chart / Syncfusion Charts
	•	Progress bars and percentage graphs

⸻

👤 User Authentication

Features
	•	User Signup (Email & Password)
	•	User Login
	•	Logout
	•	User Profile Page

Storage
	•	Authentication data stored in Firebase Authentication
	•	Attendance data stored locally on the device

Profile Page
	•	Accessed via profile icon in AppBar
	•	Displays:
	•	User name
	•	Email
	•	Logout button

⸻

📚 Subject Management

Subject Features
	•	Create a new subject
	•	Edit subject details
	•	Delete subject
	•	Each subject includes:
	•	Subject Name
	•	Unique Subject Logo/Icon
	•	Number of classes per week
	•	Weekly attendance goal
	•	Overall attendance goal (percentage or count)

⸻

📝 Attendance Tracking Logic

Per Subject
	•	User marks class as Attended / Missed
	•	Attendance stored locally
	•	Editable by the user anytime

Calculations
	•	Total Classes Conducted
	•	Total Classes Attended
	•	Attendance Percentage:

(Classes Attended / Total Classes) × 100



⸻

📈 UI & Visualization

Subject List Screen

Each subject should display:
	•	Subject logo/icon (left side)
	•	Subject name
	•	Progress bar (weekly attendance progress)
	•	Percentage text

Detailed Subject View (on click)
	•	Pictorial graph showing:
	•	Total classes vs attended classes
	•	Attendance percentage over time

⸻

⏰ Attendance Goals & Notifications

Goal Settings
	•	Weekly attendance goal per subject
	•	Overall attendance goal per subject

Notification Rules

Monday to Friday
	•	If weekly goal is not completed
	•	Send daily reminder notification:
“Don’t forget to attend your classes today!”

Saturday Morning
	•	If user fails to meet weekly goal
	•	Send alert notification:
“You missed your attendance goal for this week.”

⸻

🔔 Notification Requirements
	•	Notifications must be:
	•	Local (offline supported)
	•	Scheduled automatically
	•	User should not need internet for notifications

⸻

📂 Data Storage Structure (Local)

Subject Model

Subject {
  String id;
  String name;
  String icon;
  int classesPerWeek;
  int weeklyGoal;
  int totalClasses;
  int attendedClasses;
}

Attendance Record

Attendance {
  Date date;
  bool attended;
  String subjectId;
}


⸻

🧭 App Screens
	1.	Splash Screen
	2.	Login Page
	3.	Signup Page
	4.	Home Dashboard (Subject List)
	5.	Add/Edit Subject Page
	6.	Subject Detail Page (Graphs)
	7.	Profile Page
	8.	Logout Confirmation

⸻

🧠 AI Readability Notes
	•	Code should be modular and clean
	•	Use MVVM / Provider / Riverpod for state management
	•	Follow Flutter best practices
	•	Keep logic separated from UI
	•	Add comments where logic is complex

⸻

🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)
	•	Cloud backup sync
	•	Attendance export (PDF / CSV)
	•	Dark mode
	•	Multiple user profiles
	•	AI-based attendance prediction

✅ Final Notes

This app is privacy-focused, offline-first, and fully customizable.
The README is intentionally detailed so that an AI system or developer can build the app end-to-end without confusion.
