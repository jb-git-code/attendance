Semester End Date Attendance Constraint

⸻

Prompt / Description for AI

The application must allow the user to set a semester finish date.
All attendance calculations must be strictly limited to the period between the semester start date and the selected finish date.

Once the semester finish date is reached, the system must stop counting any further classes for attendance calculations.

⸻

Functional Requirements
	•	The user must be able to select a semester end date during setup or from settings.
	•	For each subject:
	•	The app must calculate the maximum possible number of classes until the semester end date using:
	•	Classes per week
	•	Remaining number of weeks
	•	Attendance percentage must be calculated only using classes scheduled before or on the semester end date.
	•	Classes after the finish date must:
	•	Not be counted
	•	Not trigger notifications
	•	Not affect attendance prediction or bunk calculation

⸻

Attendance Calculation Rules
	•	Let:
	•	semesterStartDate
	•	semesterEndDate
	•	classesPerWeek
	•	Remaining classes must be calculated based on the number of weeks between current date and semester end date.
	•	Attendance prediction and bunk calculator must use remaining available classes only.

⸻

UI Requirements
	•	Show the semester end date clearly in:
	•	Settings screen
	•	Subject detail screen
	•	Display remaining days or weeks in the semester:
“Semester ends in 5 weeks”

⸻

Example Scenario
	•	Semester end date: 30 April 2026
	•	Classes per week: 4
	•	Remaining weeks: 5

Total remaining classes = 20

Example warning:

“Only 20 classes are left this semester. Attend the next 3 classes to stay above 75%.”

⸻

Edge Case Handling
	•	If the current date is after the semester end date:
	•	Freeze attendance
	•	Disable marking attendance
	•	Show message:
“Semester completed. Attendance is locked.”

⸻

AI-Readability Notes
	•	Use deterministic date and time calculations
	•	Do not rely on external APIs
	•	All logic must work offline
	•	Structure code so that date constraints apply globally to all attendance features

⸻

Why This Feature Matters
	•	Makes attendance calculation realistic
	•	Prevents infinite attendance assumptions
	•	Improves accuracy of predictions and bunk calculations
	•	Essential for semester-based academic systems
