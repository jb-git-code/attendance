✔ 1. Attendance Prediction

Feature Name

Attendance Prediction System

Description

The app must continuously predict the user’s future attendance percentage for each subject based on the current attendance data and upcoming classes.

For every subject, the system should:
	•	Calculate the current attendance percentage
	•	Simulate the impact of:
	•	Attending the next class
	•	Missing the next class
	•	Display a clear warning if missing upcoming classes will cause attendance to fall below the minimum required percentage (default: 75%)

Functional Requirements
	•	Prediction must update in real-time whenever attendance is marked
	•	The prediction must be shown on the subject detail screen
	•	If the predicted attendance falls below the threshold, the UI should display a warning message

Example Output

“If you miss the next class, your attendance will drop to 72%.”

✔ 2. Bunk Calculator

Feature Name

Smart Bunk Calculator

Description

The app must calculate and display how many future classes a user can safely miss (bunk) for a subject without falling below the required attendance percentage.

For each subject, the system should:
	•	Use total classes conducted and classes attended
	•	Consider the minimum required attendance percentage (user-defined or default 75%)
	•	Calculate the maximum number of classes that can be skipped safely

Functional Requirements
	•	Calculation must update instantly when attendance data changes
	•	Result must be shown in a simple, readable format
	•	The calculator must never allow bunking that drops attendance below the threshold

Example Output

“You can safely miss 2 more classes and still stay above 75% attendance.”

✔ 3. Weekly AI Attendance Summary

Feature Name

Weekly AI Attendance Summary Generator

Description

The app must generate an automatic, human-like weekly summary of the user’s attendance using attendance data stored locally.

The summary should:
	•	Run automatically every Sunday
	•	Analyze all subjects for the past week
	•	Identify:
	•	Subjects where attendance goals were achieved
	•	Subjects where attendance goals were missed
	•	Generate a short, motivational summary message

Functional Requirements
	•	Summary must be generated locally (no internet dependency)
	•	Message must be different each week based on performance
	•	Summary must be sent as a local notification
